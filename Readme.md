One of the most common and oldest types of encryption techniques is called Caesar Cipher. Julius Caesar mainly employed this technique to communicate with his trusted allies while concealing messages from others. 

The Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption can be worked on and learned using a script, making this a challenging cybersecurity assignment. The project is built on the fundamental logic of a numeric key value, which is used to alter the position values of individual alphabets in a text. A key of numeric number “3” is applied to plain text to shift the alphabet to the right three times eventually making the plain text encrypted into the cipher text.

For example if you applied Caesar cipher on the text “SECURITY” it will be converted to cipher text “VHFXULWB”. 

The Caesar cipher can be developed using any computer language that can perform encryption and decryption operations on the text provided. This can be the best choice if you want to carry out cyber security projects.
